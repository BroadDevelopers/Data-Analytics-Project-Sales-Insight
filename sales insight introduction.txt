Problem Statement:
AtliQ hardware is a company that supplies computer hardware and peripherals to clients
-Surge stores, Nomad Stores, Excel Stores, Electricalasara Stores
fond in deli india

The challenge is this: The market is growning dynamially and the director is facing issues in terms of
tracking the sales  in this dynamically geowing market, and his having issues with the insights of his business

The director has regional marnegers of these 3 regions: North, South and Central India, to get insights in these regions
he would call these people and on the phone these regional managers would give him the insight: This was the sales
in this quarter, and we are going to grow by this much in the next quarter
-The problem is, the conversation that is happening is verbal. The regional managers usually provide excel files
instead of a clear picture

-If theres a region where sales are decling, maybe we can offer promotions, engage in customers in a better way
-A dashboard would be better than just reading a thousand excel sheets
-With these dashboards the director can:1.Identify trends of numbers 2. set monthly email reminders where at the end of the month
where powerbi send him an email telling him that this is how the business looks in terms of revenue and customers and so on

-as a sales director, he can make data based decisions which will help in increasing company sales
